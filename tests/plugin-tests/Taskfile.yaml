  # Test task, is assumed to be called from the Module.Taskfile.yaml context
  # this will likely run in the context of a CI/CD pipeline, however should
  # be runnable locally as well.
  #
  # This task will run basic plugin smoke tests for all exported plugins in
  # the solution
  #
  # Test and build steps are separated to have more control over the build and 
  # test steps. Specifically for current testing, supressing some warnings that 
  # make logs hard to read. Mock build steps should catch the warnings otherwise.
